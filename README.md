# beamer-theme-BETA

This repository provides a `LaTeX` theme implementation for the `beamer` 'documentclass' adequately consistent with the **BETA** official graphical design.

## Usage

In order to use the **BETA** theme, the following files should be included within the same directory where the main `*.tex` file resides:
 * `beamercolorthemeBETA.sty`
 * `beamerinnerthemeBETA.sty`
 * `beamerouterthemeBETA.sty`
 * `beamerthemeBETA.sty`
 * `BETA_logo.png`
 * `UdS_logo.png`
 
The **BETA** theme should be explicitly included in the *preamble* of the main `*.tex` file with the folliwing command:

```TeX
\usetheme{BETA}
```

You can compile the document with your favourite `LaTeX` engine.
